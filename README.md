# Python-scripts
A collection of various Python scripts from research and numerical computing applications

### Table of Contents:
| Script | Description                  |
|--------|------------------------------|
| A1.py | Comprises functions used to generate a random quadratic matrix, evaluate a quadratic function value and its gradient at a point, and the n-dimensional PermII test function on randomly generated input.|
| A2.py | A continuation of A1.py with added Armijo Line search and steepest descent algorithm implementations and test functions. |
| A3.py | The final installment of the thrilling series of NumPy functions using nonlinear optimization methods. This script contains an implementation of the BFGS algorithm as well as some analytic resusults of using the BFGS alg. |
| bingScrapeV3.py | Research code used to collect Bing Maps aerial imagery using geospatial data from a shapefile. Needs a valid Bing Maps key stored in a `.txt` file in the same directory as well as `bingUtilV2.py` |
| bingUtilV2.py | The secret sauce that powers `bing-scrapeV3.py`. All you need is a shapefile and a Bing Maps key to scrape the world's borders for yourself! |
