A1.py       | Comprises functions used to generate a random quadratic   |
            | matrix, evaluate a quadratic function value and its grad- |
            | ient at a point, and the n-dimensional PermII test        |
            | function on randomly generated input.                     |

A2.py       | A continuation of A1.py with added Armijo Line search and |
            | steepest descent algorithm implementations and test func- |
            | tions.                                                    |

A3.py       | The final installment of the thrilling series of NumPy    |
            | functions using nonlinear optimization methods. This      |
            | script contains an implementation of the BFGS algorithm   |
            | as well as some analytic resusults of using the BFGS alg. |
